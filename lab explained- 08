Stock Portfolio Application
This is a Solo assignment Today will be the start of an application which you will be building for several days. We will build an application that consumes data from a 3rd party API and provides our users with the ability to create stock portfolios. Once we’ve built the basic functionality of the application, we’ll introduce data analysis and visualizations into the application so we can analyze based on historical data!

Specifications
Setup
Create a new repository on GitHub called stock_portfolio, and clone the repository to your machine
Create a virtual environment with pipenv
Create a well named branch for today’s work in your stock_portfolio repository
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughtfully name and organize any additional configuration or module files
README.md - Containing good documentation for how to setup, install, and run your application
Copy all of your standard config files into the root of the project, such as .editorconfig and .gitignore, etc
stock_portfolio/tests/ - Contains test suite for your application
Create a file stock_portfolio/.env and add the following. Then Save and close.

FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
SECRET_KEY=5a9143ae-c439-4ea1-8228-5d67da63d1e4
exit and restart your virtual environment to mount that environment variable in the shell session
